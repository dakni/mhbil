Code repository of the book by Oliver Nakoinz and Daniel Knitter "Modelling Human Behaviour in Landscapes -- Basic concepts and modelling elements" published by Springer in 2016

## What will you find here?
In the next weeks we are going to provide you with
- the dataset used within the book
- the code of the different chapters

## Why do we use git to publish the material?
We decided to use git in order
- to track the changes we will make in the code [there is always a "better" way to accomplish R-related tasks]
- to encourage you to download, use, adapt, change and share your code with us and the rest of the community.

## anything more?
If you have any question, do not hesitate to contact us.
